<h1 class="h-beta text-size-2">Community Service</h1>

<p> Here in Stance Data we believe we have to give back what we have received, that's why we cooperate in different ways with our community.</p>
<p>Weâ€™re focused on Technology, Education and creating access to Opportunities with a focus to young people.</p>

<p>Everyone has the right to a good education but millions of them fail to receive it. Education is not only needed to find a good job. A person who is educated is more likely to be fully aware of their rights and are better able to ensure that they are respected.</p> 
<p>Education gives people choices, plus the confidence to take advantage of new technologies and by using productively new technologies they create new opportunities</p>

<p>That's the reason why Stance Data and its employees participate, fund and support the following grassroots efforts and activities:</p>
